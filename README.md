A collection of html snippets

## Introduction

HTML has been abstracted away as the fundamental artifact of the Internet.
It's use is hidden by layers of millions of lines of [bloated Javascript packages](https://tonsky.me/blog/js-bloat/) funded by multi-billion dollar software enterprises.
The average web developer today is pressured into using complex technologies like React just to make simple web pages.
Thus, developers learn about bloated, evanescent javascript frameworks rather than the fundamental technologies of the internet.
When we lose touch with how simple the web could be, we also lose the ability for any single individual to share and express themselves on the web.

This project serves as a public collection of vanilla HTML snippets, showing that the web can once again be simple and beautiful.
